# About The COVID Memorial

COVID-19 has touched every corner of our world, with devastating consequences to human life. These tragic deaths should not be portrayed simply as a number.

The COVID Memorial is a place to put a face and story to every number, and to commemorate all those who have sadly lost their lives due to the pandemic, either directly or indirectly.

Visit the live website: [The COVID Memorial](https://thecovid.memorial/)

If you have lost a loved one, please share their story as part of this global memorial and ensure future generations remember the people and not just the numbers.

The COVID Memorial is also a reminder that our actions can prevent further deaths. Complacency kills. Please be mindful, wear a mask, distance and respect local lockdowns.
