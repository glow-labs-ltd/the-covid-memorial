        <h3>What's in These Terms of Service?</h3>
        <p>
          These are the terms for using the The COVID Memorial Website (the

          terms for using the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We make this Website available to everyone and so you must check that
          your country's local laws allow you to use the Website. Nothing in the
          remainder of these terms of service is intended to permit or encourage
          you to do something which would normally be unlawful in your country.
        </p>

        <h3>By Using the Website, You Accept These Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>
          By using our Website, you confirm that you accept these terms of
          service and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to
          these terms, you must not use our Website. We recommend that you
          download or save a copy of these terms for future reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that we will update these terms from time to time. The
          latest version of these terms will always be found on our website at
          <NuxtLink to="/terms">www.thecovid.memorial/terms</NuxtLink>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            If you break any of these terms listed here and as a consequence, we
            suffer any loss or someone tries to sue us, you will pay us in full
            for all loss we suffer including our legal fees and other
            costs/expenses.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <h3>There Are Other Terms That May Apply to You</h3>
        <p>
          These are some other terms, which also apply to your use of the
          Website:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Our <a href="#privacy">Privacy Notice</a>, (this talks about how we
            use the information that you give us or that we hold about you).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's very unlikely, but if something in the Privacy Notice doesn't
          make sense because of these terms, these terms will apply regardless.
        </p>

        <h3>How We Provide the Website</h3>
        <p>
          The Website allows users to commemorate individuals that have died as
          a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Users can add memorials for their
          loved ones, and read memorials uploaded by other users.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not require users to create accounts with The COVID Memorial to
          upload or read memorials.
        </p>
        <p>
          The COVID Memorial is not responsible for the information uploaded
          onto the Website and is unable to verify the accuracy of any memorial.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can't promise that the Website will always be available or quick,
          because the Website depends on the servers that host it, the Internet,
          your WiFi or other local connection and other technical things to
          work. We also can't promise that there won't be bugs or errors with
          the Website. We will always try to make sure that you have access to
          the Website at all times and that the Website is up to date, but
          cannot guarantee that this will always be the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Website isn't available, or we need to stop providing it, we'll
          try to let you know as soon as we can via our social media accounts.
          We can change or end the Website at any time, for any reason, and
          we'll try to give you as much notice as possible via our social media
          accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to make sure that your device is able to access the Website
          (this might mean needing to download the latest software). As with
          anything that you access via the internet, you should also ensure that
          your device has appropriate and up to date antivirus and firewall
          software installed. If you have any trouble accessing the Website,
          just let us know at
          <a href="mailto:contact@thecovid.memorial" target="_blank"
            >contact@thecovid.memorial</a

        </p>

        <h3>Ending Your Use of the Website</h3>

          immediately.
        </p>

        <h3>Terms About Linking to Our Website</h3>
        <p>
          You may link to our Website, provided that you do so fairly and
          legally, and you don't damage our reputation. Don't link to our
          Website in a way that suggests The COVID Memorial knows or endorses
          you. You can only link from a website that you own or to your own
          social media or blogging pages.
        </p>

        <h3>The COVID Memorial's Rights</h3>
        <p>
          We can change these terms at any time and will try our best to let you
          know about any major changes. If you disagree with our changes, you'll
          have to stop using the Website. If you keep using the Website after
          any changes, we'll assume you're okay with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may update and change the Website at any time. We will try our best
          to let you know about any major changes via our social media accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're very happy to hear your thoughts and ideas about the Website but
          if you tell us them, and we use them, we don't have to pay you any
          money for them or tell anyone that it was your idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can ban you from using the Website if you break our terms, if we
          think you might try to break the terms or if you lie to us in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you break the law, or we think you might try to break the law, we
          will tell the police and share your information with them.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Responsibility to You</h3>
        <p>
          We can't promise that the Website will always be available. We won't
          be responsible to you for anything that happens if you can't access
          the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's very unlikely but if the Website damages your device, let us know
          and we'll try to help you. We can't promise that we'll be able to help
          but we'll give it a go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding what is said above, if we are found to be responsible
          to you for anything at all, then provided you evidence your loss and
          can show us that you have done all you can to minimise it, then we may
          compensate to a maximum of £5.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>1. Personal information we use</h3>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, information which relates to deceased individuals
          is not classed as personal data. Nevertheless, we may from time to
          time collect and use personal data that you upload to the website as
          part of the memorials you post. We will also collect some data from
          you via the cookies we use to provide the website to you. More details
          regarding the cookies we use can be found below.
        </p>

        <h4>1.1 Information we collect:</h4>
        <p>
          To post a memorial, or comment on a memorial, you do not need to
          create an account or provide any of your own personal data. We only
          collect data about the deceased person the memorial is intended to
          commemorate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are posting a memorial, we will ask for the following
          information about the deceased:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>their name;</li>
          <li>their date of birth, date of death and age;</li>
          <li>the country they lived in;</li>
          <li>the town/city they lived in;</li>
          <li>
            we also ask that you write a respectful message to accompany these
            details, giving more information about the deceased’s life;
          </li>
          <li>memorial sharing links.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We also ask, as far as possible, that you do not include personal data
          about any living individual as part of the memorial you post.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide to support the work of our project, your personal
          financial data may be processed by the third-party payment provider in
          accordance with their own privacy notice – they will not share that
          personal data with us.
        </p>

        <h4>1.2 Where do we get personal data from?</h4>
        <p>
          We only collect the personal data you upload to the website when
          submitting the memorial. We discourage you from revealing any of your
          own personal data in either the memorial message, or in the memorial
          comments, as these are publicly viewable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We request that memorials are only uploaded by family members or close
          friends of the deceased, and that you seek permission or agreement
          from the deceased’s next-of-kin before posting the memorial.
        </p>

        <h4>1.3 Information we collect about you from other sources:</h4>
        <p>
          We may also obtain information about you from your social media pages,
          if you choose to interact with The COVID Memorial via your social
          media accounts.
        </p>

        <h4>1.4 Your device data:</h4>
        <p>
          In the course of your visit to this website, we collect the following
          technical device data automatically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the date and time on which you access a page on our website;</li>
          <li>how you interact with the website; and</li>
          <li>
            information about the device you are using (e.g. type of device, web
            browser, operating system and IP address)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not link this data to other personal data you provide and the
          data is only used for internal purposes in connection with the
          administration of and improvements to the website, and by third party
          service providers to provide support services in connection with those
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also third-party cookies on the website, which collect some
          information about you. Please see section 9 for further information.
        </p>

        <h4>1.6 Employees, candidates and third-party providers</h4>
        <p>
          If we engage with you in your capacity as an employee of Glow Labs
          Limited, a candidate or third-party service provider, we may collect
          the following information, whether from you directly or from a third
          party:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>name;</li>
          <li>email address;</li>
          <li>postal address;</li>
          <li>telephone number;</li>
          <li>employment information;</li>
          <li>
            other information about your identity, such as your date of birth,
            your marital status, in-case-of-emergency contact details and gender
            (including special category data);
          </li>
          <li>financial data, such as your bank account details; and</li>
          <li>device data as set out above at section 1.4.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          2. How we use your personal information and the basis on which we use
          it:
        </h3>
        <p>
          We use the information that you provide to us (which includes the
          deceased’s personal information) to make the memorials publicly
          available and for the purposes of the memorial set out on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must have a legal basis on which to process this personal
          information. The legal bases on which we rely are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            that we are providing a service in the public interest to
            memorialise those around the world who have passed as a direct or
            indirect consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic;
          </li>
          <li>
            we also consider that affording individuals around the world with a
            platform on which to memorialise those they have lost, and to draw
            attention to the scale of the global impact of this pandemic, serves
            a legitimate interest which justifies the very limited processing of
            personal data which is associated with that; and
          </li>
          <li>
            to the extent that any processing of personal data is not covered by
            those bases, we consider that your provision of the said personal
            data amounts to your explicit and unequivocal consent for us to
            collect and process that personal data in the way described in this
            privacy notice. You may withdraw your consent (and request us to
            cease processing under either of the other legal bases described
            above) at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of
            this privacy notice.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your rights over personal information</h3>
        <p>
          Although as we have explained above the usual rights in relation to
          personal data are generally not regarded as applying to the personal
          data of the deceased, we intend to respect the following rights in
          relation to any personal information stored on the site (which
          includes anything which is defined in law as personal data):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>access to the personal information;</li>
          <li>rectification of the personal information we hold;</li>
          <li>
            requests that we erase the personal information (provided that there
            is a good lawful basis for erasure);
          </li>
          <li>restriction of our use of the personal information;</li>
          <li>objections to our use of the personal information; and</li>
          <li>
            withdrawal of your consent to our processing of the personal
            information – unless we can rely on another legal basis.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have any concerns about our processing of personal information,
          we would ask you to make us aware of it in the first instance, but you
          are always able to lodge a complaint with your local data protection
          authority, which, in the UK, is the Information Commissioner's Office.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage you to update or correct the deceased’s information if it
          changes or is inaccurate. To do this, please email
          <a href="mailto:contact@thecovid.memorial" target="_blank"
            >contact@thecovid.memorial</a
          >
          to request an update to be made.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Information sharing</h3>
        <p>
          We may share the deceased’s personal information with third parties
          under the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As is apparent from the information published within the memorial
            site, the information is being placed into the public domain.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may share the deceased's personal information with our service
            providers and business partners that perform business operations for
            us. For example, we may partner with other companies to optimise our
            services, analyse information and promote the website;
          </li>
          <li>
            We may share information with law enforcement agency, courts,
            regulator, government authority or other third party’s where we
            believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory
            obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of any
            third party; and
          </li>
          <li>
            We may share personal information with any third party that looks to
            take over responsibility for, or to which we transfer, the memorial
            or all or substantially all of our assets and business. Should such
            a transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the
            entity to which we transfer your personal information uses it in a
            manner that is consistent with this privacy notice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The recipients referred to above may be located outside the
          jurisdiction in which you are located (or in which we provide the
          services). Please see section 8 for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned, we do use third party cookies on the website. Please see
          section 9 for further information.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Information security and storage</h3>
        <p>
          We implement technical and organisational measures to ensure a level
          of security appropriate to the risk to the personal information we
          process. These measures are aimed at ensuring the on-going integrity
          and confidentiality of personal information. We evaluate these
          measures on a regular basis to ensure the security of the processing.
        </p>

        <h3>6. How long we keep personal data</h3>
        <p>
          We will keep the deceased’s personal information for as long as their
          memorial is on our website. If you decide that you no longer want the
          memorial to be on the website, we will retain their personal
          information for a period of time that enables us to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            maintain our business records for analysis and/or audit purposes;
          </li>
          <li>comply with record retention requirements under the law;</li>
          <li>defend or bring any existing or potential legal cases;</li>
          <li>deal with any complaints regarding the services; and</li>
          <li>
            any other purposes for which your personal information needs to be
            retained.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will delete their personal information as soon as it is no longer
          required for these purposes, or, in any event, no later than 12 months
          after you request it is deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is any information that we are unable, for technical reasons,
          to delete entirely from our systems, we will look to anonymise or
          pseudonymise this information so that the deceased cannot be
          identified from it.
        </p>

        <h3>7. International data transfer</h3>
        <p>
          Information that you provide is published on the memorial website and
          may be visible to anyone with an internet browser who visits the
          website, from anywhere in the world. We ask that you do not place
          personal data of any identifiable living person within the memorial,
          but if you do so then you will also be consenting to any transfer of
          that personal data which might result from such placement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not currently intend to transfer, store and process personal
          data outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area. It may
          be, from time to time, that it is necessary for us to make a transfer
          of personal data to a country (a “third country”) which is neither
          within the UK or EEA nor a country in relation to which the UK
          Secretary of State or the EU Commission has made a finding of adequacy
          in connection with its data protection regime. In those circumstances
          we will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place which will be
          documented in a data sharing or data processing agreement using the
          model clauses approved by the EU Commission or (where applicable) by
          the UK Secretary of State in accordance with the UK-GDPR.
        </p>

        <h4>8.2 Third party social media cookies</h4>
        <p>
          Third parties may also use cookies whenever you link a memorial to
          your social media accounts. These third parties include Facebook and
          Twitter. We have no control over these cookies, and so are not
          responsible or liable for them. Please refer to the relevant privacy
          policy for further information about how that social media company
          uses your personal data.

        <h3>9. Anonymised data</h3>
        <p>
          We collect, use and share anonymised data such as statistical or
          demographic data to track users of our website. Anonymised data could
          be derived from the deceased’s personal data but is not considered
          personal data because this data will not directly or indirectly
          identify the deceased. However, if we combine or connect anonymised
          data with the deceased’s personal data so that it can directly or
          indirectly identify them, we treat the combined data as personal data
          which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.
